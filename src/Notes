What did I do?

Move the SDK into a component

Why?

Because I wanted to perform functions on the buttons so that I can 
play/pause however that can only be done by accessing the ID of what I should 
be grapping (which you cannot find the normal way?)

So now my issue is that I have pulled in the info but I cannot access it as 
it will just error out on click (because I have to make a new
instance of the player)

So what do I need help with
- Well it looks better to have the info inside a component
- But if I was to take it out of a component and back into pure JS in
  the index.html how would I find the id of the image (so that it would
  register the click)
- Or if I was to keep it in what way could I access the methods to update
  the SDK call?
  I was thinking localstorage to keep the OAuthToken however i don't have 
  a clue how this works....So ask Lucian 
- UPDATE now it does not error yet nothing happens i.e it does not actually
  DO anything...it just doesnt break so thats better right?
